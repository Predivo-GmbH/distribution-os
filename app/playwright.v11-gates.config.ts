 * v11 hardened audit gates (Gates A/B-J/I/K/M) against the deployed staging site
 * (staging.distributionos.predivo.ch). Heavier than the deploy-gauntlet E2E: seeds/cleans
 * DB rows via the Supabase Management API, so it needs DIST_MGMT_TOKEN. Run by
 * staging-gates.yml (post-deploy + weekly), and DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED from the deploy
 * gauntlet (playwright.config.ts testIgnores e2e/staging/**), which has no Management token.
 *
 * Auth: e2e/staging/auth.setup.ts performs a real Supabase login on the STAGING project
 * (jckctrtkstejolddqzlk) and persists the session into storageState.
 *
 * Run locally with:
 *   STAGING_HTTP_USER=... STAGING_HTTP_PASS=... \
 *   DIST_MGMT_TOKEN=sbp_... \
 *   STAGING_TEST_EMAIL=e2e-test@distributionos-test.local STAGING_TEST_PASSWORD=... \
 *   npx playwright test --config playwright.v11-gates.config.ts
