/**
 * relay-auth.prod.test.mjs — production/staging regression guard for the send-auth-email
 * open-relay fix (signal-fleet:send-auth-email:unauthenticated-relay).
 *
 * The function used to check a Standard-Webhooks signature ONLY when one was present. This
 * project's Send-Email hook is a Postgres hook called through pg_net with no signature at all,
 * so "no signature" meant "no check": any holder of the public website key could POST a crafted
 * payload and make Distribution-OS mail a login or password-reset code to an address of their
 * choosing. It now requires EITHER a valid signature OR the internal shared secret in
 * `x-send-email-secret`, which the send-email hook reads from Vault
 * (`send_email_internal_secret`) and sends on every relay call. Enforcement is gated on the
 * edge function's own SEND_EMAIL_INTERNAL_SECRET being set.
 *
 * WHY A LIVE PROBE AND NOT A UNIT TEST. The gate is inert until a secret exists in two places
 * that live nowhere in this repo (a Vault row and an edge-function env var). A test that reads
 * index.ts stays green through an entire exposure — on Valrano the code half was committed
 * 2026-09-02 and production was STILL an open relay on 2026-09-04, with every source-reading
 * test green throughout. Only asking the live endpoint can tell "the fix shipped" apart from
 * "the fix is in effect".
 *
 * Self-contained — needs no credentials, which is the whole point: an unauthenticated caller
 * must be refused. A 400 here is the FAILING state, not a passing one: 400 "No email in payload"
 * is a complaint about the body, which is only reached after authentication.
 *
 * Run: node supabase/functions/send-auth-email/relay-auth.prod.test.mjs
 * Exit 0 = relay closed on every checked project; non-zero = a project is an open relay again.
 *
 * IF THIS FAILS, the most likely cause is not a code change: the Vault secret is DATA, not
 * schema, so a `supabase db reset` / re-provision drops it. Re-seed the Vault row
 * (`send_email_internal_secret`) BEFORE the migration is re-applied, then re-set the edge
 * variable SEND_EMAIL_INTERNAL_SECRET to the same value — Vault first, env var last, or auth
 * email goes down for real customers.
 *
 * Ported from Valrano/supabase/functions/send-auth-email/relay-auth.prod.test.mjs, which was
 * itself ported from BackOffice and originally from ChannelMover. Diff the four before changing
 * any of them.
