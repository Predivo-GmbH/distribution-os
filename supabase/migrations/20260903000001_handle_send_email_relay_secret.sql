-- handle_send_email — send the internal shared secret to send-auth-email.
--
-- WHY (fleet:send-auth-email:unauthenticated-relay): the send-auth-email edge function used to
-- verify a Standard-Webhooks signature ONLY when one was present. This relay is a Postgres hook
-- called through pg_net with no signature at all, so "no signature" meant "no check", and any
-- holder of the public website key could POST a crafted payload and make the product mail a
-- login / password-reset code to an address of their choosing. Measured on production on
-- 2026-09-03: an unauthenticated POST of `{}` answered 400 "No email in payload" — a complaint
-- about the BODY, which is only reached after authentication. The edge function now accepts
-- EITHER a valid signature OR an internal shared secret in `x-send-email-secret`, with
-- enforcement gated on its own SEND_EMAIL_INTERNAL_SECRET env var being set.
--
-- THIS MIGRATION IS THE DATABASE HALF, AND IT MUST BE LIVE BEFORE THAT ENV VAR IS SET.
-- Rollout order (getting it wrong takes auth email down for real customers):
--   1. vault.supabase_url + vault.service_role_key → this function has something to read
--   2. this migration            → relay is ready to send the header
--   3. deploy the edge function  → still inert, env var unset, nothing changes
--   4. vault.send_email_internal_secret → the relay starts sending the header
--   5. SEND_EMAIL_INTERNAL_SECRET on the edge function → enforcement turns on, header already flowing
--
-- THE SECRET IS READ FROM VAULT AT CALL TIME AND IS NEVER WRITTEN INTO THIS FUNCTION BODY.
-- Do not "simplify" this by inlining the value: a function body is readable by anything that can
-- introspect the catalogue, and doing exactly that leaked a sibling product's live production
-- secret into a transcript on 2026-09-02. THE PREVIOUS DEFINITION OF THIS FUNCTION ON THIS
-- PROJECT DID EXACTLY THAT — measured 2026-09-03, `pg_get_functiondef` contained a JWT — so this
-- migration also removes a hard-coded service_role key from the catalogue.
--
-- The header is OMITTED when the Vault secret is absent, so this migration is a no-op on any
-- environment that has not been provisioned yet (and on a fresh `supabase db reset`, where Vault
-- contents are DATA and do not survive). Re-seed with:
--     bash scripts/seed-email-relay-vault.sh <project-ref>
-- which sets the Vault secret and the matching edge-function secret together, in that order.
--
-- Modelled verbatim on ChannelMover/supabase/migrations/20260903_001_handle_send_email_relay_secret.sql.
-- Diff the two before changing either.
